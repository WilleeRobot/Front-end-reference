            <p>This guide is a simple reference tool created to serve as a memory aid for learning and solidifying front-end development concepts. It will be continuously updated as time allows and hopefully grow to include discussions, observations, and learnings about other front-end development frameworks.</p>

        <!-- HTML Section -->
        <section class="html">
            <h2>HTML</h2>
            <p>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the basic building block of any webpage.  It defines the content and structure of any webpage. Other languages that are typically used in front-end web development such as JavaScript and CSS (below) define the overall appearance, style, and interactivity of the page itself. 

                The <span>hypertext</span> part of the language refers to links that connect web pages to one another. This can be either internal links or external links. 
                
                The <span>element</span> in HTML is what provides instruction for any given piece of content on the page. These elements are setoff from other pieces of text on the page via ‘tags’. </p>
        </section>

        <!-- CSS Main - Description Section -->
        <section class="CSS">
            <h2>CSS</h2>
            <p>Cascading style sheets (CSS) is code that defines styles applied to a website. It is not considered to be a language or even markup. Rather it uses <span>Selectors</span> and <span>Declarations</span> to define the styles to be applied to HTML elements. Declarations are in turn comprised of a <span>property</span> and a property <span>value</span>. 

                Things that can be styled are plenty. Examples include but are not limited to color, size, text size, font properties, shapes, and more. 
                
                Layouts can also be uniquely fine-tuned to cause the webpage to look and feel according to how you like. Columns can be created in addition to scrolling boxes, floating elements, and more.</p>

        <!-- CSS Layout - Description Section -->
        <section class="CSS-layout">
            <h3>CSS - Layout</h3>
            <p>CSS layout techniques allow us to take elements in a webpage and control their positioning relative to the following factors: it’s default position in a <span>normal layout</span>, other elements on the page, it’s parent container, and the overall viewport.

                The primary method of controlling the layout of elements is by using the <span>display</span> property.
            </p>
            <p>The table below summarizes the most commonly used property values associated with the <span>display</span> property.</p>
